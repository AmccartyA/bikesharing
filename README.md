# Bikesharing
 
## Overview
This project was designed to analyze data available on bike uses and apply that information to starting a Bike shop in Des Moines, Iowa. The main tool we will be using is tableau to provide visualization for our data.
 
## Results
Our Tableau Story contains 7 visualizations to help explain the data we were able to gather. Some highlights include:
 
* Peak rental hours are between 5 to 6 hours
* Male users show a higher chance to rent a bike
* Looking at the trips per weekday. Thursday is a predominantly busy day for biking

## Summary
While are data was from a large Urban area (New York) we can still gather a lot of useful information. First, we should put together a data visualization of men's peak hours.I think single men looking to get into shape at peak hours would help the business grow.  Next during the colder months we should expect less riders so the company will need to figure out other methods to generate revenue. We could put together a visualization of repairs or sales during those months and possibly offer deals to existing customers.
